ASU is proclaimed to be the number one school in innovation. However, have you ever wondered why this is the case? Here are some thoughts as to my experience with this matter. 

I think that ASU's innovation is superior to that of other universities since ASU's curriculum doesn't teach innovation for the sake of innovation, but rather nails in how innovation can be used to create value to benefit the lives of others. Specifically, an important aspect is how a product is not only new, but also better than the status quo and more valuable. Additionally, the curriculum does a good job of teaching the process of innovation and the different facets that go into this. As a result, I am extremely willing to work hard to create valuable solutions for those whom I care about. I think that it is my duty to do everything I can to make the world a better place.

So you have decided to take part in the magic of innovation, but are overwhelmed by the steps that you should take to build up a new business. Don't fret, since ASU has lots of resources to help you out.

E&I@ASU, or entrepeurship and innovation, provides resources for students with an entrepeurial mindset to network with other students and have the knowledge and mastery to create solutions to the problems they are attempting to solve. The program does a good job of providing specific resources to specific individuals depending on the phase of the entrepeneurial spectrum that they are currently in. For example, if one is just starting or is interested in becoming an entrepeur, there are a handful of ways to engage in this activity, including talking at others at the Generator labs or attending a hackathon through devils invent. If one wants to further their entrepeurial learning, s/he can take advantage of resources at epics@asu or KEEN. Finally, if one has solidified an entrepeurial idea, they can attempt to obtain funding or assistance through organizations like venture devils or eSeed Challenge.

You may be wondering if you should investing time in order to learn how to engage in the entrepeneurial mindset. The answer is a resounding yes!

An entrepreneurial mindset has incredibly positive effects for how one approaches general problems in the future both in one's future occupation and one's daily life. Whenever one encounters a problem, it is easy to simply brush it off as a given without much thought as to how one could create a valuable solution to such a problem. However, with an entrepreneurial mindset, one can look at problems from the perspective of someone actively looking for pain points that one could jump start a solution from. Instead of viewing problems as expected or given, one can start to actively give thought to how that problem set could be solved and how exactly solutions can provide significant value to others. With this, one has the tools to shape the world into however way that individual would envision the world should look.

So you have a great idea, but now need to actually assemble the units necessary for building your new startup. What do you have to do now?

One aspect that I am excited about is the process of building a capable team that can handle the different facets of covering all the bases of your new startup business. One of the interesting ideas that the article mentions is the importance of having a diverse idea-set within a team, which also necessitates having individuals with conflicting opinions. With this sort of communication, different team leads can fill in the weaknesses in character or knowledge that other team members may have. Having this dynamic in a team can propel a startup quickly.

When we develop a product to solve a problem, we often assume that we have more information and knowhow than we assume. However, this assumption can be deadly for actually creating something that matters.

Despite one's best effort, it is incredibly difficult to consider every single perspective on a problem, since humans are inherently biased. We are more prone to considering perspectives that match our own opinions on subjects than those that contradict them. As a result, when considering any problem, we automatically look at the problem in our own unique light, focusing on the parts of the problem that we believe to be important to us. However, of course, that perspective may be different substantially if a business major is looking at the problem versus if a engineering major is examining the problem. These discrepancies highlight the importance of considering multiple perspectives -- it fills in the gaps of knowledge of some individuals with the strengths of others.

One important market research strategy that resonated with me is the necessity to "seek the devil's advocate." This is especially true for me since I always find myself biased with respect to how great my personal ideas are when, to others, the idea may not necessarily be as glamorous as it seems. I want to actively work to respond better to the criticism and, instead of taking it personally, internalizing the arguments are come up with ways to make my product better. One good approach that Chmouni mentions is, when describing the idea to others, describing the idea as one that your friend came up with instead of you. When placed in this position, your conversation partner may be more inclined to give harsher criticisms of the product since he or she may not think these criticize you directly. I think that this suggestion, combined with improvements in internalizing criticism, can help make this iterative process much more likely to result in a product that actually serves the needs of your customers.

Obtaining feedback on your product can be hard, but it is extremely important in shaping your product into one that actually meets the needs of your customers.

An interesting innovation management tool is a business model canvas. Such tools can help your business win in in their specific industry.

A big downfall of many startups is that they quickly lose sight of their core objectives and start to spend time and resources on things that do not project them towards a certain goal. As a result, they start to do many things in a very mediocre way, but do not focus on excelling at a few important things. As a result, competitors that do certain things better start to overtake them and they lose dominance in their respective field. Innovation management tools such as the business model canvas help guide businesses to focus on their core objectives by providing a user interface to siphon resources to the important things that matter. With these devices in place, employees and founders can use these tools as crutches whenever they determine whether a certain business action truly adds value to the product.
