ASU is proclaimed to be the number one school in innovation. However, have you ever wondered why this is the case? Here are some thoughts as to my experience with this matter. 

I think that ASU's innovation is superior to that of other universities since ASU's curriculum doesn't teach innovation for the sake of innovation, but rather nails in how innovation can be used to create value to benefit the lives of others. Specifically, an important aspect is how a product is not only new, but also better than the status quo and more valuable. Additionally, the curriculum does a good job of teaching the process of innovation and the different facets that go into this. As a result, I am extremely willing to work hard to create valuable solutions for those whom I care about. I think that it is my duty to do everything I can to make the world a better place.
