ASU is proclaimed to be the number one school in innovation. However, have you ever wondered why this is the case? Here are some thoughts as to my experience with this matter. 

I think that ASU's innovation is superior to that of other universities since ASU's curriculum doesn't teach innovation for the sake of innovation, but rather nails in how innovation can be used to create value to benefit the lives of others. Specifically, an important aspect is how a product is not only new, but also better than the status quo and more valuable. Additionally, the curriculum does a good job of teaching the process of innovation and the different facets that go into this. As a result, I am extremely willing to work hard to create valuable solutions for those whom I care about. I think that it is my duty to do everything I can to make the world a better place.

So you have decided to take part in the magic of innovation, but are overwhelmed by the steps that you should take to build up a new business. Don't fret, since ASU has lots of resources to help you out.

E&I@ASU, or entrepeurship and innovation, provides resources for students with an entrepeurial mindset to network with other students and have the knowledge and mastery to create solutions to the problems they are attempting to solve. The program does a good job of providing specific resources to specific individuals depending on the phase of the entrepeneurial spectrum that they are currently in. For example, if one is just starting or is interested in becoming an entrepeur, there are a handful of ways to engage in this activity, including talking at others at the Generator labs or attending a hackathon through devils invent. If one wants to further their entrepeurial learning, s/he can take advantage of resources at epics@asu or KEEN. Finally, if one has solidified an entrepeurial idea, they can attempt to obtain funding or assistance through organizations like venture devils or eSeed Challenge.

You may be wondering if you should investing time in order to learn how to engage in the entrepeneurial mindset. The answer is a resounding yes!

An entrepreneurial mindset has incredibly positive effects for how one approaches general problems in the future both in one's future occupation and one's daily life. Whenever one encounters a problem, it is easy to simply brush it off as a given without much thought as to how one could create a valuable solution to such a problem. However, with an entrepreneurial mindset, one can look at problems from the perspective of someone actively looking for pain points that one could jump start a solution from. Instead of viewing problems as expected or given, one can start to actively give thought to how that problem set could be solved and how exactly solutions can provide significant value to others. With this, one has the tools to shape the world into however way that individual would envision the world should look.
