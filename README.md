ASU is proclaimed to be the number one school in innovation. However, have you ever wondered why this is the case? Here are some thoughts as to my experience with this matter. 

I think that ASU's innovation is superior to that of other universities since ASU's curriculum doesn't teach innovation for the sake of innovation, but rather nails in how innovation can be used to create value to benefit the lives of others. Specifically, an important aspect is how a product is not only new, but also better than the status quo and more valuable. Additionally, the curriculum does a good job of teaching the process of innovation and the different facets that go into this. As a result, I am extremely willing to work hard to create valuable solutions for those whom I care about. I think that it is my duty to do everything I can to make the world a better place.

So you have decided to take part in the magic of innovation, but are overwhelmed by the steps that you should take to build up a new business. Don't fret, since ASU has lots of resources to help you out.

E&I@ASU, or entrepeurship and innovation, provides resources for students with an entrepeurial mindset to network with other students and have the knowledge and mastery to create solutions to the problems they are attempting to solve. The program does a good job of providing specific resources to specific individuals depending on the phase of the entrepeneurial spectrum that they are currently in. For example, if one is just starting or is interested in becoming an entrepeur, there are a handful of ways to engage in this activity, including talking at others at the Generator labs or attending a hackathon through devils invent. If one wants to further their entrepeurial learning, s/he can take advantage of resources at epics@asu or KEEN. Finally, if one has solidified an entrepeurial idea, they can attempt to obtain funding or assistance through organizations like venture devils or eSeed Challenge.

You may be wondering if you should investing time in order to learn how to engage in the entrepeneurial mindset. The answer is a resounding yes!

An entrepreneurial mindset has incredibly positive effects for how one approaches general problems in the future both in one's future occupation and one's daily life. Whenever one encounters a problem, it is easy to simply brush it off as a given without much thought as to how one could create a valuable solution to such a problem. However, with an entrepreneurial mindset, one can look at problems from the perspective of someone actively looking for pain points that one could jump start a solution from. Instead of viewing problems as expected or given, one can start to actively give thought to how that problem set could be solved and how exactly solutions can provide significant value to others. With this, one has the tools to shape the world into however way that individual would envision the world should look.

So you have a great idea, but now need to actually assemble the units necessary for building your new startup. What do you have to do now?

One aspect that I am excited about is the process of building a capable team that can handle the different facets of covering all the bases of your new startup business. One of the interesting ideas that the article mentions is the importance of having a diverse idea-set within a team, which also necessitates having individuals with conflicting opinions. With this sort of communication, different team leads can fill in the weaknesses in character or knowledge that other team members may have. Having this dynamic in a team can propel a startup quickly.

When we develop a product to solve a problem, we often assume that we have more information and knowhow than we assume. However, this assumption can be deadly for actually creating something that matters.

Despite one's best effort, it is incredibly difficult to consider every single perspective on a problem, since humans are inherently biased. We are more prone to considering perspectives that match our own opinions on subjects than those that contradict them. As a result, when considering any problem, we automatically look at the problem in our own unique light, focusing on the parts of the problem that we believe to be important to us. However, of course, that perspective may be different substantially if a business major is looking at the problem versus if a engineering major is examining the problem. These discrepancies highlight the importance of considering multiple perspectives -- it fills in the gaps of knowledge of some individuals with the strengths of others.

One important market research strategy that resonated with me is the necessity to "seek the devil's advocate." This is especially true for me since I always find myself biased with respect to how great my personal ideas are when, to others, the idea may not necessarily be as glamorous as it seems. I want to actively work to respond better to the criticism and, instead of taking it personally, internalizing the arguments are come up with ways to make my product better. One good approach that Chmouni mentions is, when describing the idea to others, describing the idea as one that your friend came up with instead of you. When placed in this position, your conversation partner may be more inclined to give harsher criticisms of the product since he or she may not think these criticize you directly. I think that this suggestion, combined with improvements in internalizing criticism, can help make this iterative process much more likely to result in a product that actually serves the needs of your customers.

Obtaining feedback on your product can be hard, but it is extremely important in shaping your product into one that actually meets the needs of your customers.

An interesting innovation management tool is a business model canvas. Such tools can help your business win in in their specific industry.

A big downfall of many startups is that they quickly lose sight of their core objectives and start to spend time and resources on things that do not project them towards a certain goal. As a result, they start to do many things in a very mediocre way, but do not focus on excelling at a few important things. As a result, competitors that do certain things better start to overtake them and they lose dominance in their respective field. Innovation management tools such as the business model canvas help guide businesses to focus on their core objectives by providing a user interface to siphon resources to the important things that matter. With these devices in place, employees and founders can use these tools as crutches whenever they determine whether a certain business action truly adds value to the product.

It is always interesting to not only look at the startups who attract millions of users, but also the ones that fail miserably. One such article, attached at the bottom, describes how this may happen. 

Many of the failures delineated in the article boil down to not respecting the difficulty of getting users to start the adoption of a new product in the first place. Many startups like to envision how successful their product is with an established and loyal customer base, but the process to establish that customer base can often be incredibly difficult. As a result, it is much better to be incredibly precise with a smaller group of customers and incrementally appeal to additional groups as the development process is underway. This takes the form of not only understanding the customer pains, but also the specific monetary costs of those pains and the amount that they are willing to spend in order to bypass those pains.

The Dollar Shave Club is an incredibly successful company that advertised shipping razors to people for just a dollar a month. How did they get to this point?

Michael Dubin's success was not necessarily from the superiority of his products, but rather the way that he was able to connect with his audience in order to antagonize the absurdly high prices of his competitors. In his video, he uses storytelling and comedy in order to present his no-bells-and-whistles product that provides the very minimal necessary service at a very cheap price. I think by presenting the topic in this method, he makes a very convincing argument why paying so much extra for features of a razor that are simply unnecessary is a waste of money, and why his service of a simply one dollar a month is a much better way of getting shaving done. As a result, he changes the way that public perception is towards razors.

When creating innovation, it is incredibly important to consider how the future world would potentially benefit from our solution. However, actually performing this prediction is rather difficult, but we can use current trends to give us hints to the right direction. One possible tool may be to use current themes as a basis.

In the attached article, it describes twelve "mega themes" that it states will drive the future world. Some of these themes attached include automation, which is the usage of machines to perform many tasks that humans have traditionally performed, and connected living, which is the ability for an individual to stay connected with his or her peers all the time. By having information of these trends, innovators can make more informed decisions about what technologies to invest time to look into, since one being at the forefront of developing products in these frontiers will always be at an advantage. For example, if a clothing company sees that virtual reality may become more widespread in the future, they may start looking into VR technologies that allow users to try on different clothes in a virtual environment. 

So always be on the lookout for emerging trends! You won't know which ones may materialize into something big.

One of the common assumptions that many people make about innovation is that it is only for startups -- the new up and coming companies creating value in new places that were never conceived of before. However, this thought is simply not true. Many existing companies too use the ideas of innovation in order to drive the continual production of value for their company.

One such company is Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos. One of the interesting things that Bezos does each year is write a message to shareholders about the lessons that he learned throughout the year that contributed to that year's success. One such takeaway was his 2016 message, which stated that it was important to "move fast and focus on outcomes." In this year's message, he stated the importance of not being held back by company beauracracy and be willing to make decisions as fast as startups. Specifically, whenever the company identifies a new space that is possible to generate additional value, the company must move fast before another competitor takes that place first. 

These conclusions help even large existing companies create value as quickly as startups!

Nowadays, the term "startup" has a bad rep. It is tied with the perception that a company scales up quickly, gets millions of customers, then quickly obtains high valuation with a product that is barely functional. Granted, many startups do start with the fast and scrappy approach, but continually doing something like this sets that company up very negatively in the longterm. For these startups, a very difficult transition is the one from the minimally viable product phase to a viable product. This comes with the necessity of coming to terms with the fact that it is important to start doing things the right way, instead of continually finding more shortcuts to solve the problems in the short-term.  In other words, make a service that people actually want, rather than make something that you think people want. Coming to this maturation as a company is incredibly important to do but also requires many pedagogical shifts in the process.

As a concept, entrepeneurship is often seen as a joke with the sheer amount of companies that have made grand claims about an idea but have no factual evidence to support their claims. The below video depicts some of the humorous ideas that many "entrepeneurs" tout and highlights how absurd many of these startups actually seem from a different lens. To be a truly successful startup that generates value over a longer period of time, it is important to not make these illogical claims about your idea, but rather gather legitimate data and take a scientific approach on investigating the truth of certain claims. While you may be confident that your idea is truly the best one for a specific problem, this claim holds no truth until you actually go out into the field and verify whether it is accurate. This approach is especially important considering that you and your team may hold certain biases that may skew how you perceive a certain idea or decision more negatively or positively that it should be. Real entrepeneurs are very scientific by nature, and this video highlights how important this pragmatic approach is in bringing your startup to success.

Everybody knows that creating a startup requires funding, but most people assume that the only pathway towards this funding is pitching your product to a venture capitalist organization who may wish to help with funding. However, as the video attached mentions, there are many other potential options for funding, and it is important not to restrict your startup to a single one.

One such option is bootstrapping your own business; this option essentially takes the approach of not entertaining any idea of third-party funding and simply handling all operations privately. This approach has numerous benefits, such as increased equity in the company and more company autonomy. However, obviously, this option may make it difficult to maintain a steady stream of operations throughout the business, and your company may be overtaken by competitors that may have more funding. The other option, of course, is finding investors. While you may lose some autonomy in your product, you may find that this option may be preferable due to the additional capital your company has to work with or the additional mentorship that you may be able to receive from your investors. As a result, it is important to consider all potential options you have in receiving capital before you decide to take the leap.
